# OfficerTracker
A 100% client-side web app built with React and Tailwind CSS that helps employees track their monthly office attendance based on custom company policies. Users can set their join date, working-days-per-week policy, and public holidays, then mark office days on a visual calendar.


# 💡 Key Features

📅 Join-date-aware tracking — calculates static working days, required attendance, and progress.

🎯 Customizable policy — adjust days-per-week target and holidays anytime.

💾 Local storage persistence — data never leaves your browser.

🔗 Share & backup — export/import JSON or generate a sharable link.

🌐 Offline-ready — 100% client-side, deployable on Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages.
